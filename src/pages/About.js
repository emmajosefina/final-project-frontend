Other tools we used during this time was Figma, Canva, and three creative and problem solving brains. <span role="brain" aria-label="brain emoji">ðŸ§ </span></LongerTexts>

<SecondHeader>Thanks thanks and thanks</SecondHeader>
<LongerTexts>Last but not least, we would like to give a huge thank you for all the support to Max (Joannas soon to be husband) for being such a great support during this time. He helped us when we got stuck and taught us many things we will take with us in our journey as developers. Also, Sara Carlstein is a great person who helped us a lot. We are beyond grateful for all the support.</LongerTexts>
